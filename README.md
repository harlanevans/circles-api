# Circles API

Welcome to the **circles-api** project! This is a development project that I'll be working on and growing over time. The primary goal of this project is to explore various topics related to Node.js, containers, Docker, and Kubernetes (K8s) tools. While the project is still in its early stages and the API's functionality is yet to be defined, I aim to create something practical and potentially useful down the road. Whether it's about managing data about plants, cats, or any other topic, I'm excited to embark on this journey.

## Project Overview

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to gain hands-on experience and understanding of the following key areas:

1. **Node.js**: Exploring the inner workings of Node.js and building a RESTful API using it.
2. **Containers**: Leveraging containerization to package and deploy the application consistently across various environments.
3. **Docker**: Learning how to create Docker containers for the API and manage them efficiently.
4. **Kubernetes (K8s) Tools**: Exploring K8s tools like Kubernetes itself, Helm, and others for container orchestration and management.

### Project Status
As of now, the project is in its early stages, and many details are yet to be defined, including the specific functionality of the API. However, this project will evolve over time as I delve deeper into the topics mentioned above. Feel free to check back regularly for updates on the project's progress.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/harlanevans/psychic-telegram.gitependencies**: 
```

Navigate to the project directory and install any necessary dependencies. Since the project is in its early stages, this may vary, but typically you can use npm or yarn for Node.js projects.

```
cd circles-api
npm install
```

3. **Run the Project**: Start the Node.js application, and if there is any API functionality, you can test it by making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

```
npm start
```


4. **Containerization**: If you want to explore containerization with Docker, there may be Dockerfiles and instructions included in the project in the future. You can build and run Docker containers as per the provided guidance.

5. **Kubernetes**: If you wish to explore Kubernetes and related tools, you can deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster. Specific instructions will be added as the project progresses.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether it's adding new features, improving existing code, or providing insights into the topics being explored, your input is valuable. Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes, commit them, and push to your fork.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

## Roadmap

The project roadmap is still being defined and will evolve over time. Planned milestones include:

- Defining the API's functionality and endpoints.
- Containerizing the application with Docker.
- Exploring Kubernetes tools for deployment and scaling.
- Enhancing the project documentation.
